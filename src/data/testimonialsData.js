      "I just wanted to congratulate you on the Treenuts material school, it was truly excellent,it made me want to run out and buy some nuts for their nutritional benefits. The course was extremely clear, with a very good flow, and I learnt a lot. I also really liked the detail that you went into in the cleaning etc…I think this is quite similar to cocoa, so I would definitely recommend my cocoa SQA's to take this course.",
